# Lens Board

Lens Board is a custom mechanical keyboard, with a modified 1800's layout, more physical input methods (sliders, scrolly wheel, touchscreen) and an inbuilt, *physical* audio visualizer.

#### The Why

My inspiration for this project was my [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/) project, which I had a ton of fun designing and building. I wanted to make another thing to do with keyboards, and this was a great opportunity to do so.

In terms of the actual design choices of the keyboard, I'm a massive fan of analog / physical inputs and outputs. As a musician and LD, I like faders, so a few of those were an obvious choice. 

I decided to add a music visualizer because its just something I'm passionate about, putting some form of visual representation to sound. I do lighting for this reason, and I made my [music visualizer](https://cookiemonsternz.github.io/music-visualiser/) for high seas also because of this.

Anyways, here are some shots of my project :)

*This is without the plate, as I couldn't fit it into the budget. I am planning on machining this using my schools cnc.
