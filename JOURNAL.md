# Lens Board
Lensboard is a keyboard! I did hackpad v1, but didn't get to do hackpad v2 due to exams :(
Other than being a keyboard, Lensboard has some unique features...

### Introducing...
ANALOG INPUTS!
Physical controls are the single most satisfying thing in the world. Clicky, scrolly, wavy, whatever - as long as it's physical, it's fun.

### The Plan

Quick overview:
- 1800 Compact Layout (Fullsize but squished)
- Low profile
- White backlight
- RGB underglow
- Audio Visualizer (physical)
- Scrolly Wheel (clicky)
- Fader
- Mini touchscreen (for color pickers, music player)

#### Audio Visualizer
Basically, this is a line of little rods, that move up and down based on a fft of the audio input. They're moved by ten litte stepper motors (because servos are noisy as hell).

Here is my amazing diagram:
